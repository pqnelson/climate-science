\chapter{Partial Differential Equations}

\begin{node}\label{pde-0000}%
Partial differential equations usually begins by studying first-order
linear partial differential equations, then moving on to the ``big
three'' of second-order linear partial differential equations (Laplace's
equation, the wave equation, and the heat equation). Nonlinear partial
differential equations are seldom discussed in undergraduate courses
because they are so difficult that each nonlinear PDE merits its own
field of study.

\begin{definition}\label{pde-0001}%
We define a \define{Domain} in $\RR^{n}$ to be a non-empty, open,
connected subset $U\subset\RR^{n}$.

More generally, we can speak of domains in topological space.
\end{definition}

\begin{node}\label{pde-000B}%
Morally, there is some intuition that we ``build solutions'' out of
``wave equations''. There is some degree of truth to this, but it gets
us only so far in life.
