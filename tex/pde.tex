\chapter{Partial Differential Equations}

\begin{node}\label{pde-0000}%
Partial differential equations usually begins by studying first-order
linear partial differential equations, then moving on to the ``big
three'' of second-order linear partial differential equations (Laplace's
equation, the wave equation, and the heat equation). Nonlinear partial
differential equations are seldom discussed in undergraduate courses
because they are so difficult that each nonlinear PDE merits its own
field of study.

\begin{definition}\label{pde-0001}%
We define a \define{Domain} in $\RR^{n}$ to be a non-empty, open,
connected subset $U\subset\RR^{n}$.

More generally, we can speak of domains in topological space.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{pde-000D}%
A \define{Partial Differential Equation} consists of
\begin{enumerate}
\item a domain $\Omega\subset\RR^{n}$ containing a subdomain
  $\Omega_{0}\subset\Omega$ (for the initial data);
\item a degree $k$ differential operator $P\colon C^{k}(\Omega)\to C^{0}(\Omega)$;
\item some initial data $u_{0}\in C^{j}(\Omega_{0})$ for some suitable
  $j\in\NN_{0}\cup\{\infty,\omega\}$.
\end{enumerate}
A \define{classical solution} to such a PDE consists of a function $u\in C^{k}(\Omega)$
such that $P(u)=0$ and $u|_{\Omega_{0}}=u_{0}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{node}\label{pde-000C}%
The questions that we want to answer include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Does a solution exist?
\item Is the solution unique?
\item Does the solution change continuously as we change the initial data?
\end{enumerate}
When a partial differential equation has a unique solution which varies
continuously with respect to changes in the initial data, we say the
partial differential equation is \define{Well-posed}.

But there's also the important problem of \emph{how do we even find solutions?}
\begin{node}\label{pde-000B}%
Morally, there is some intuition that we ``build solutions'' out of
``wave equations''. There is some degree of truth to this, but it gets
us only so far in life.
