\chapter*{Preface}

This is an attempt to collect and collate my thoughts, notes, readings
on physics, chemistry, biology, climate science, and the related
mathematics needed to understand them. It would be nice to have a
``self-contained text'' which starts with elementary algebra, builds a
computer algebra system (CAS) to formalize what has been learned,
applies the CAS to physics, and so on. But this would be a pipe-dream, a
bridge too far.

\section*{Stylistic Choices}

\subsection*{Programming} There will be numerical analysis done in these
notes. I am deliberating what language (or languages) should be
used. \FORTRAN\ has become tolerable since 1990, when it began to
imitate Pascal. But still, I am a Lisper at heart, and the heart wants
what the heart wants.

However, the use of code is to show the \emph{intent} of something, not
to actually code it up.


\subsection*{Calculations} I am going to use Dijkstra's ``structured
derivations'' for performing calculations. It is a beautiful thing. The
basic structure looks like
\begin{calculation}
  A
  \step{hint why $A=B$}
  B
  \step{hint why $B=C$}
  C
\end{calculation}
We can change the relational operator, for example
\begin{calculation}
  A
  \step[\leq]{hint why $A\leq B$}
  B
  \step{hint why $B=C$}
  C
\end{calculation}
Or we may work with sequences of equations
\begin{calculation}
  A=B
  \step[\equiv]{hint why $B=B'$, $A=A'$}
  A'=B'
  \step[\equiv]{hint why $B'=C$}
  A'=C.
\end{calculation}
It's a wonderful thing.
